/// * `await` - suspend execution until the result of a `Future` is ready
/// * `break` - exit a loop immediately
/// * `const` - define constant items or constant raw pointers
/// * `continue` - continue to the next loop iteration
/// * `crate` - in a module path, refers to the crate root
/// * `dyn` - dynamic dispatch to a trait object
/// * `else` - fallback for `if` and `if let` control flow constructs
/// * `enum` - define an enumeration
/// * `extern` - link an external function or variable
/// * `false` - Boolean false literal
/// * `fn` - define a function or the function pointer type
/// * `for` - loop over items from an iterator, implement a trait, or specify a
///   higher-ranked lifetime
/// * `if` - branch based on the result of a conditional expression
/// * `impl` - implement inherent or trait functionality
/// * `in` - part of `for` loop syntax
/// * `let` - bind a variable
/// * `loop` - loop unconditionally
/// * `match` - match a value to patterns
/// * `mod` - define a module
/// * `move` - make a closure take ownership of all its captures

/// * `struct` - define a structure
/// * `super` - parent module of the current module
/// * `trait` - define a trait
/// * `true` - Boolean true literal
/// * `type` - define a type alias or associated type
/// * `union` - define a [union][union]<!-- ignore -->; is only a keyword when used
///   in a union declaration
/// * `unsafe` - denote unsafe code, functions, traits, or implementations
/// * `use` - bring symbols into scope
/// * `where` - denote clauses that constrain a type
/// * `while` - loop conditionally based on the result of an expression
///
